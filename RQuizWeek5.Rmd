1.

```{r}
(A <- matrix(c(1,-1,-1,-1), nrow = 2, ncol =2))
(B<- matrix(c(2,3,-1,-2), nrow=2, ncol=2))
(C <- matrix (c(1,0,0,0), nrow=2, ncol=2))
(D <- matrix(c(0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1), nrow= 3, ncol=3))
```

2.
An idempotent matrix is a matrix that, when multiplied by itself, returns the same matrix. In this case, matrices C, D and E are idempotent because $1*1=1$ and $0*0=0$

3.
We can prove a matrix is orthogonal if each of the column vectors multiplied by each of the other column vectors are equal to 0
For example, A is orthogonal because there are only 2 column vectors:
$(1*-1)+(-1*-1) = 1 + (-1) = 0$; that means itâ€™s orthogonal.
It turns out this is the case for matrices A, C, D and E; all of the matrices that are only made up of 1s, 0s, and -1s.

4.
```{r}
(bigList <- list(A, myArray, theDF, x))
